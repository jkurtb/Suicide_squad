### Introduction

The United Nations (UN) General Assembly passed a resolution in 2011 that said “the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal”. It called on governments to "give more importance to happiness and well-being in determining how to achieve and measure social and economic development." 

Now it might seem an odd time to start a project about world happiness. After all, how can someone be really happy during a global pandemic? 

But we've all thought that we'd be happier with more cash in our pocket at some point or another; and it's only natural to feel unhappy and stressed when money's tight. This is precisely why now is the right moment to explore readily available data, to be able to analyze trends over time and correlate factors that impact happiness across the world. 

While some would argue that “Rich countries are definitely happier than poor countries,” this project will look into other variables other than a country's economic health.

### Mission

Utilize Python, Pandas, Numpy and Data Visualization tools to answer the following questions: 

+  How does the happiness index look across the globe?
+  Does economic health correlate with happiness? 
+  What other factors impact happiness? 
+  How do outlier countries perform within the UN's happiness index variables?
+  How do outlier countires perform with other factors?
+  How does Canada compare with outlier countries? 
+  How does Canada compare to US?
+  Is it changing over time? 

### Data Background

Our primary dataset is derived from annual World Happiness Reports (WHR) published by the UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It is then merged with other data obtained from the GHDx (Global Health Data Exchange) - University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, The World Bank, ... and

### Hypothesis

"Economic Health in terms of GDP and Unemployment are not correlated to Happiness"
  
"Other factors (variables exclusive of UN's WHR) do not impact Happiness"
  
### Data Cleaning
  
Our datasets were downloaded in the form of csv files. The cleaning process starts with each sources of data, dropping irrelevant columns, renaming column headers, and replacing Nan values with the average value between prior and succeeding year data. Subsequently, all data points were transformed through a function matrix and merged into a single dataframe. There's also a separate table prepared, containing normalized values during analysis.  

### Data Analysis

An initial data analysis was conducted during the "pre-work" phase in order to reframe specific questions this project intends to pursue. When the group had identified certain factors and outlier countries of interests to focus on, the main analysis proceeded with correlation and regression of variables among those highlighted countries.

   **_Observable Trends/Insights:_** 
  GDP had a strong positive correlation with Happiness Index. On the other hand, Unemployment rate showed a negative correlation.
  
  **Costa Rica** , **Spain** , **Brazil** , **Nicaragua** have been identified as outliers.
